# 🎨 How We Made Cool Charts and Shared Them with Friends

**A Simple Guide for Anyone to Understand!**

---

## 📚 What Did We Do?

Imagine you want to draw really cool, interactive charts that move and change colors - like the ones you see on websites! We made exactly that, and then we put them online so your friends can see and use them too!

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Getting Our Art Supplies (Installing Tools)

Just like you need crayons and paper to draw, we needed special computer tools to make our charts.

### What We Installed:

1. **Plotly** - Think of this like a magical paintbrush that can draw charts
   - It makes: line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and even 3D pictures!
   - The charts can move and change when you touch them (like a video game!)

2. **Dash** - This is like a website builder for kids
   - It creates a whole webpage with buttons and charts
   - You can click buttons and watch the charts change!

3. **Other Helpers** - These are like helpers that do math and organize things:
   - **Pandas** - Organizes information in tables (like a spreadsheet)
   - **NumPy** - Does really fast math
   - **SciPy** - Does special science and math calculations

### How We Got Them:
We typed a magic command: `pip install plotly dash`
- "pip" is like a store that gives us free tools
- It downloaded everything we needed in seconds!

## 🎨 Step 2: Creating Our Art (Making the Python Files)

We created **6 different art projects** (Python files). Each one does something cool!

### Project 1: "Dummy Test Script" 🧪
- **File:** `# Dummy test script.py`
- **What it does:** Prints "Hello!" to make sure everything works
- **Think of it like:** Your first crayon scribble to test if the crayon works

### Project 2: "Simple Charts" 📊
- **File:** `plotly_example.py`
- **What it does:** Makes a simple line chart and bar chart
- **Think of it like:** Drawing a simple stick figure - easy and quick!
- **You see:** Two charts pop up in your web browser

### Project 3: "Fancy Charts" ✨
- **File:** `plotly_advanced.py`
- **What it does:** Makes 5 super cool charts!
  1. A dashboard with 4 charts in one picture
  2. A 3D mountain you can spin around
  3. An animated chart where dots move around
  4. A stock market chart (like what grown-ups use for money)
  5. A colorful heat map that shows connections

- **Think of it like:** Drawing a whole comic book page with lots of pictures!

### Project 4: "Science Charts" 🔬
- **File:** `plotly_data_science.py`
- **What it does:** Makes 6 charts that scientists use!
  - Shows how numbers spread out
  - Finds patterns in data
  - Spots numbers that don't belong (outliers)
  - Draws best-fit lines through points

- **Think of it like:** Using special art techniques artists use, but for numbers!

### Project 5: "Simple Dashboard" 🖥️
- **File:** `dash_app.py`
- **What it does:** Creates a mini-website with:
  - A dropdown menu (like choosing flavors of ice cream)
  - Charts that change when you pick different options
  - Numbers that tell you important information

- **Think of it like:** Building a little game where you press buttons and things happen!

### Project 6: "Super Dashboard" 🚀
- **File:** `dash_advanced.py`
- **What it does:** This is our masterpiece! It has:
  - **3 different pages** you can switch between (like tabs in a notebook)
  - **Page 1 (Sales):** Shows how many things were sold over time
  - **Page 2 (Products):** Compares different products
  - **Page 3 (Regions):** Shows which areas sold the most
  - **Special Feature:** A "Start Live Updates" button that makes the chart change by itself every 2 seconds!

- **Think of it like:** Building a whole art gallery with different rooms!

---

## 📖 Step 3: Writing Instructions (README and Requirements)

We created 3 special helper files so anyone can use our projects:

### File 1: README.md 📝
This is like a "How to Use This Toy" instruction booklet!
- Explains what each project does
- Shows how to run them
- Lists what's inside

**Think of it like:** The instruction manual that comes with a LEGO set

### File 2: requirements.txt 📋
This is a shopping list of all the tools we need!
- Lists: plotly, dash, pandas, numpy, scipy
- When someone else uses our project, their computer reads this list and gets everything automatically

**Think of it like:** A recipe card that lists all ingredients

### File 3: .gitignore 🚫
This tells the computer which files NOT to share
- We don't share junk files or temporary stuff
- Only the important files get shared

**Think of it like:** Cleaning your room before friends come over - hide the messy stuff!

---

## 🎯 Step 4: Saving Our Work (Using Git)

**What is Git?**
Git is like a time machine for your work!
- It remembers every change you make
- You can go back to old versions if you make a mistake
- It helps many people work together without messing things up

### What We Did:

1. **Started Git** (`git init`)
   - We told the computer: "Start remembering everything I do in this folder!"
   - This created a hidden folder called `.git` that saves all our history

2. **Told Git Who We Are** (`git config`)
   - We said: "My name is Keti Bakiri"
   - We said: "My email is keti.bakiri.murray@gmail.com"
   - Now Git knows who made the changes!

3. **Saved Our Work** (`git add .` then `git commit`)
   - `git add .` = "Hey Git, look at ALL these files!"
   - `git commit` = "Take a snapshot of everything right now!"
   - We wrote a message: "Initial commit: Add Plotly and Dash visualization examples"

   **Think of it like:** Taking a photo of your LEGO tower so you can rebuild it if it falls down

## 🌍 Step 5: Sharing with the World (Using GitHub)

**What is GitHub?**
GitHub is like a playground where people share their projects!
- It's a website where you can upload your code
- Other people can see it, download it, and use it
- It's like Google Drive, but for computer code!

### What We Did:

1. **Created a Home on GitHub**
   - We went to GitHub.com and created a new "repository" (a fancy word for "project folder")
   - We named it: "Test-Dash"
   - This is like creating a new folder on Google Drive

2. **Connected Our Computer to GitHub** (`git remote add origin`)
   - We told our computer: "When I say 'send it online,' send it to this address:"
   - Address: `https://github.com/ketibakirimurray-code/Test-Dash.git`

   **Think of it like:** Writing down your friend's address so you can mail them a letter

3. **Uploaded Everything** (`git push`)
   - We pushed ALL our files to GitHub
   - Now they're online for everyone to see!
   - 9 files, 835 lines of code - all uploaded!

   **Think of it like:** Uploading photos to Instagram so friends can see them
